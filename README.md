**PixelatedCanvas.py** is a Python project that generates stunning pixel backgrounds using various rules and sizes. It's like having a virtual art studio where you can unleash your creativity and create mesmerizing pixel masterpieces! 🎉✨

## Features

- 🌈 Generate pixel backgrounds with different rules and sizes
- 🎨 Customize the number of images to generate
- 📊 Specify the desired size of the generated images
- 🖼️ Save the generated images in the `output` directory
- 🎥 Create GIFs from the generated images using `gif_script.py`
- 🌟 Easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) for seamless interaction

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
  - `git clone https://github.com/your-username/PixelatedCanvas.py.git`
2. Install the required dependencies:
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Run the `gui.py` script:
  - `python gui.py`
2. Select the desired rule, size, and number of images to generate using the GUI.
3. Click the "Generate Images" button to start the image generation process.
4. The generated images will be saved in the `output` directory.
5. To create a GIF from the generated images, run the `gif_script.py` script:
  - `python gif_script.py`
  - The resulting GIF will be saved in the `gifs` directory.
6. Alternatively, you can manually run script.py by uncommenting the last part of the code and specifying different settings:
  - Open `script.py` in a text editor.
  - Uncomment the last part of the code (e.g., remove the # symbols).
  - Modify the generate_images() function call with your desired settings, such as the number of images, width, height, and rule index.
  - Save the changes and run `script.py` directly:
           ` python script.py` This allows you to generate a large number of images in a batch, for example, generating 1,000,000 images in a row with specific sizes and rules.

Note: Be cautious when generating a large number of images, as it may take a considerable amount of time and consume significant system resources.

Note: GIF generation using gif_script.py can take a long time, especially for a large number of images. If you encounter issues or find the process too time-consuming, you can alternatively use different scripts or websites for GIF creation, such as https://ezgif.com/maker, which provides an online tool for creating GIFs from a set of images.
